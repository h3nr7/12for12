12 for 12 was a fundraising event during COVID-19 lockdown in London where volunteers rode 12 hours on indoor trainers, primarily on Zwift representing the long hours of shifts NHS workers have to endure.  This is the repo of the website used to track users on the actually event date and showcase images and data of the participants.

### Tech stack

* React - TypeScript
* Node
* Express
* Mongo

### API

* It also accesses the JustGiving and Zwift Companion API as well as data aggregated in mongo via the self hosted express API.

##### note:
This was a very quick build with no intention to be maintained.  However it did serve as an important proof of concept for [PUGGO](https://puggo.co), a concept that is being brewed, built and tested for gamification of sports including cycling.
